In February 2024 I travelled to Sweden, where I during the course of 10 days, meditated for 100 hours total.

In 2023 while scrolling through YouTube, I was recommended a video called "I Meditated in Silence For 10 Days". Having been interested in psychology, philosophy and mindfulness since childhood, this video piqued my interest. I watched some of the video and was introduced to the term "Vipassana". I bookmarked the video as it seemed interesting and forgot about it.

Six months later I was doing a digital cleanup, where I cleared all of my bookmarks. During this I stumbled upon the video again. After looking at the Vipassana website, I was very surprised to not only learn that a course was entirely free, but also that they offered 1, 3, 10, 30 or 60 day courses. Having wanted to go on similar retreats for a long time, I decided I may as well do it now. 10 days seemed ideal, it wouldn't disrupt my Computer Science studies too much, but it would also give me a better idea of the experience, unfortunately it was impossible for me to find any 10 day courses in Denmark. The closest one was in Sweden, having never taken public transport myself this actually made me nervous, but I figured it was time to get over that fear as well. February 5th I sent a message to my friends, family and teachers, saying that they wouldn't be able to contact me for a while.

At five in the morning, I was waiting for the train in Central Jutland, Herning. Three hours later I was in Aalborg, where I had 3 minutes to run from the train station to the bus station. I continued north towards Frederikshavn, where I boarded the ferry going to Gothenburg in Sweden. Now it was official.

While travelling I wrote in my journal about the fears, expectations and motivations for this journey. It seemed intuitive to meditate while travelling, so I did though I knew that it was very late to start preparing for the 10 days... I knew they weren't going to be easy.

A couple of hours went by and then I arrived in Gothenburg. Having booked a small room in a hostel, I started walking towards it, for a place to rest and stay the night.

The room was nice and simple, I was getting ready to rest. Apparently though I had a roommate. He came in with headphones on, though the audio was so loud it sounded like regular speakers. As day became night he walked in and out of the room. 3:15 he opened a bag of chips, I gave up. 3:30 in the morning I was now exploring Gothenburg. It was quite lovely.

I didn't pack food for multiple days though, and as I had to take a train later, I needed some sort of breakfast. A couple of kilometers away from the hostel, there was a McDonalds which was open 24 hours a day.

After walking some more, at 5:15 in the morning I found myself at the Gothenburg Centralstation, where I
waited for my train to Mjölby.

Four hours later at 9:15, I was now in Mjölby, it was freezing cold with a lot of snow. The travel wasn't done yet though. At 14:15 a bus would arrive to pick people up for transportation to the Vipassana center. So I needed something to do. Being tired from a lack of sleep and cold from the Swedish weather conditions, I was looking for some place to stay, ideally without paying as I didn't have a lot of money. Not being able to find a library, my eyes turned to the church. I went inside, sat on a bench and listened to a woman practicing her vocals for an hour and two. I couldn't resist the temptation to lay down and take a nap, one hour later I woke up in the church and decided to get lunch at a chinese buffet nearby. I started walking towards the bus stop, quickly being greeted by other Danish people. The bus ended up not having space for all of us, so I and four other people stayed behind and waited an hour to be picked up by another bus. We were now driving towards the Vipassana centre.

At 16:10 we arrived.

We went inside to the main building, giving away our phones, jewelry, books, headsets and more, to dedicate the next 10 days fully to the experience. They gave out small flyers with the daily schedule, which looked like this:

The flyer also contained The Code of Discipline:
> All who attend a Vipassana course must conscientiously undertake the following five precepts for the duration of the course:
>
> 1) to abstain from killing any being;
> 2) to abstain from stealing;
> 3) to abstain from all sexual activity;
> 4) to abstain from telling lies;
> 5) to abstain from all intoxicants.
>
> There are three additional precepts which old students (that is, those who have completed a course with S.N. Goenka or one of his assistant teachers) are expected to follow during the course:
>
> 6) to abstain from eating after midday;
> 7) to abstain from sensual entertainment and bodily decorations;
> 8) to abstain from using high or luxurious beds.

This was going to be interesting.

All participants (100+ people) were assigned a room in one of the gender-segregated buildings. I went to my room, prepared my bed, clothes and so on, whereby shortly after my roomate for the next 10 days entered. We spoke a little, he was from Stockholm.

A couple of hours later the bell / gong was rung, which signaled that we should be going towards the meditation hall. Each of us had our own place to sit in the meditation hall, with our own pillows and blankets. The men sat on the left side with green blankets, women sat on the right side with white blankets. Two people entered the room at the very front, and sat on some tables raised above us all. Those were our teachers, one male and one female.

We sat down and waited in silence, a recording was started of the teacher [S. N. Goenka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._N._Goenka). I almost started laughing as I'm sure many others did. The recording started with S. N. Goenka humming and singing in his own unique way.

He explained that for the next ten days we would be challenged mentally and physically. Some of us will want to quit day two and six he warned. We were told that when we leave this room, we were to avoid all forms of communication, unless it was completely necessary. No talking, gestures or eye-contact. With our eyes closed we ended the session with a mantra, sending vibrations through the entire hall, it felt magical. We all stood up, headed to our room in silence and went to sleep.

# Anapana
February 7th I woke up at 3:00... laying in bed I contemplated the challenge that was ahead, waiting, daydreaming. An hour went by and the morning bell was struck, I got out of bed, took a short shower and went to the meditation hall.

Most who have meditated will have tried Anapana meditation, where you focus on the breath, every inhale and exhale. This is similar to how we started. If we imagine a triangle from each corner of the mouth to the point between the top of the nose, this was the area we were to focus on. We closed our eyes and then observed sensation caused by the breath, that popped up within that area. Whether it was the cold air on the nostrils or the breath hitting the hair above the lip. We were told to notice it and focus on it. Like any type of meditation with intentional focus, a major obstacle is met immediately... the inability to focus. One moment you're looking for a sensation, the next moment you catch yourself in a daydream, that you've been thinking about for the last five minutes. ["The Monkey Mind"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYG5VvHry7c&index=2) as Goenka called it. Your mind starts wandering off again, but noticing the sensations gets quicker and easier.

Instructions were given by an audio recording of Goenka speaking English. Then a Danish recording would play right after, explaining it again. There'd be long periods of silence, at times interrupted by Goenka humming, singing or reminding us what this journey is about.

After two hours of noticing physical sensations and training one's focus, it was time for breakfast. Each person was given a specific seat, this is where we ate for both meals each day. Breakfast always had some porridge with raisins, seeds, tea, honey, bread and butter. No coffee was allowed. Like most other people, when I was done eating I engaged in one of three main activities... resting in my room, taking a walk in the Swedish nature or meditating some more. A large section of the forest was marked with colored tape, we were not allowed to leave the area. There were two marked areas in the forest, one for men and one for women.

After the break we meditated some more, sometimes in our own room, at other times in the meditation hall. At one point we'd have lunch, usually some hot vegan meal. Later we'd also have a tea break, which for new students (like me) included some fruit. Older students were only offered tea.

During one of the meditation sessions, our names were called one by one, in groups of four. One of the teachers, would call the name of four students, followed by four of us sitting down in front of the teacher, being asked questions about the location of the physical sensations and the intensity. After that we return seats or go back to our room. This was repeated until every student had sat in front of the teacher. After that the other teacher would repeat the process, for the opposite gender.

Each day would end with a [video recording of Goenka talking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz7QHNvNFfA&list=PLPJVlVRVmhc4Z01fD57jbzycm9I6W054x) about the day, the challenge that lies ahead, as well as thoughts and stories about his personal life, Buddhism, health and more. He'd often make most of us laugh, with his funny stories and jokes.

This was the daily structure, ten hours of meditation every day, two meals, one tea break and one hour of dedicated rest time.

As we kept practicing, we were instructed to narrow our focus. So instead of a triangle from the corners of the mouth to the nose bridge, we'd now focus on the upper lip and nostrils, noticing any sensation within this area. This was then later changed to focus _only_ on the upper lip.

### Vipassana
The first couple of days laid the groundwork, where we practiced narrowing our focus and observing the tiny physical sensations caused by the breath. But now we started scanning our body from head to toe, very slowly, following the instructions as given by Goenka. First we focused on the top of our head, waiting until we felt a physical sensation, whether it was temperature, itching, pain, sweat or any other physical sensation. What's interesting is that as one scans down the body, it's still possible to feel some of the sensations observed earlier. So even though I was now scanning my left arm, I could still feel some of the sensations on the top of my head. We kept moving our focus down, covering more and more of the body in these vibrations. It felt pleasant.

As we reached our toes, Goenka told us to move our focus back to the top of the head... this was it. Everything dissappared, my entire existence. Vibrations were radiating from the top of my head throughout my entire body. I could feel myself shaking, but my body was gone. The entire universe was taken over by vibrations, I felt content. As our physical body was disintegrating in this sensory explosion, Goenka said "there is not past, there is no future, there is only Vipassana". We opened our eyes, the meditation session was done. Several people started crying and laughing. The experience was bliss.

Now came the next major challenge, the purpose of several philosophies, religions and Vipassana. To reduce suffering. As humans we have a tendency to repeat positive experiences, to chase the same effects as before. We are addicts, constantly seeking positive emotions, feelings and physical sensations. In Vipassana this is the foundation of all suffering, craving. We repeated the process of scanning our body, but now it was with the goal of noticing the sensations, while not trying to force them and without attaching ourselves emotionally to whether they feel good or bad. Noticing uncomfortable sensations like pain and itching, accepting that they're there and taking note of the sensations.

A day or two after the first Vipassana experience, it was about to become much harder.
